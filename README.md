## HellooooðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate student at The University of Texas at Dallas, where I am pursuing a Master of Science in Information Technology and Management. 
My goal is to apply my passion, analytical skills, and data-driven mindset to solve complex business challenges and drive organizational growth.

I am a data scientist with four years of impactful consulting experience at Deloitte in analyzing data, building predictive models and interactive dashboards.

I am excited about the transformative power of data and its ability to revolutionize decision-making processes. 
Whether it's uncovering hidden patterns, optimizing operations, or driving strategic initiatives, I am dedicated to leveraging data to unlock new possibilities and create value. 

I am eager to connect with like-minded professionals, share insights, and explore potential collaborations that bridge the gap between consulting expertise and the transformative potential of data science.
